This is an example for Android platform which acts like user could use longpress / touch to select single word in a textview. 
Just like ios platform magnifier in web browser. 

Here you could see the picture, figure 1. 
When you touch any words in the textview, it will popup a toast to show which word you selected. 
Try it.
